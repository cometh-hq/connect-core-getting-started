# Cometh Core - Getting Started

This repository contains examples on how to use the Connect Core SDK.

## Overview

Cometh Connect is an SDK that enables applications to provide their users with a smart wallet controlled via biometrics.
Coupled with a Web2 authentication system (or as a standalone solution to maintain anonymity), users are onboarded with the convenience of Web2 and the security of Web3: biometric signatures (passwordless and non-custodial), gasless transactions, account recovery, and more.

### Features

- Instant wallet creation via account abstraction.
- Gas fee sponsorship via the Cometh paymaster.
- Session keys for a seamless UX.
- Recovery system for users.
- Utilizes modern JavaScript and Web3 libraries for an enhanced development experience.

### Repo Structure

- `view-demo/`: Lightweight demo showing how to use the core SDK directly with Viem.
- `react-hooks-demo/`: Demo showcasing the hooks we've developed to facilitate React usage.
